# Open Life Science 2

Welcome! This is the [second cohort of Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/ols-2) (OLS-2) program repository. 
This repository will be used for the issue tracker feature of GitHub. 
All the [projects in OLS-2]() will use one issue to keep track of their progress during the program.
Notes from the cohort calls will be stored in the [ols2-cohort-calls](directory https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-2/blob/ols2-cohort-calls).

## How to Work With Us

Each issue will provide details for a project currently going through OLS-2. 
Find out more about each project how you can get involved in the individual issues.
